# Workarounds for Halo Custom Edition using Lua

Different files for fixing/tweaking/restoring Halo Custom Edtion mainly based in Lua scripts
for Chimera.

**All the files here are release files, you can drag and drop it in your global scripts folder
and they must work.** 

## Available scripts:
- **Dynamic Reverb Sound**:
  Provides reverberation for sounds that does not have it by default like melee, reload, grenade throw.
- **FP Animation Permutation**:
  Reimplements first person animation permutation by using the OpenSauce animation label format.
